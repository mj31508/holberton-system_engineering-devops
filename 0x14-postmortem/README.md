Markup : ### Issue Summary ###

On August 10th from 9:00am PST until August 10th 3:pm PST, Github.com wasn't
accepting my push request for the AirBnB_V2 project. At its peak, this issue
affected the single user (me) from being able to complete this portion of the
project in a respectable time frame. The root cause of the issue was Github.com
recognizing a repository that was linked to a different individual at
Holberton School.

Markup : ### Root cause ###

At 1:00PM PST, a configuration change was made via Guillame Salva. The change specified
that the current repo of user1 (Max Johnson) was linked to the repo of user2 (John coleman).
Since the AirBnB project code base is linked to user2 and user1 originally collaborated
with user2 at the beginning of the AirBnB project, Github didn't recognize the files
eventhough they were pushed to user1's repository.

Markup : ### Resolution ###

At 3:00pm PST, a new repository was made and properly configured to be recognized by
The Holberton School's checker.

Markup : ### Corrective and Preventative Measures ###
